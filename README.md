# Image-Classification-using-Bayers-s-Theorem.

Developed a Python-based project to analyze average intensity in R, G, B channels and composite images, using a dataset
of 50 "Daytime" and 50 "Nighttime" images from Google Image Search.
Applied Bayesian probability to calculate and visualize conditional PDFs and CDFs for Daytime and Nighttime images,
enhancing the classification process.
